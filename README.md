This repository hosts a simple React progressive web app. Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the directory to try it out. It works offline after the first load.

The app now includes a basic WebRTC example for peer-to-peer data communication using a data channel. Use the buttons in the UI to create an offer, share the SDP with another user, and exchange JSON messages once the connection is established.

## Development

Run `npm test` to execute the placeholder test script.
